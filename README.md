GroupedListControl-Published
============================

This code accompanies a walk-thru tutorial, [Extending C# Listview with Collapsible Groups (Part I)](http://typecastexception.com/post/2012/05/09/Extending-C-Listview-with-Collapsible-Groups-(Part-I).aspx) in which I build out a basic extenstion of the common Windows Forms ListView control. In the article I discuss:

* Adding expandable/collapsible groups with header columns to the ListView
* The use of Inner Classes to extend and manage the child collection of ListViewItem Groups
* A few basic WinApi calls to menage vertical and horizonal scrollbars within the nested lists
